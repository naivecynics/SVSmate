## Project Architecture & UI Design

### Architecture Diagram

**Core Modules**

VSCode API acts as the primary interface and runtime for integrating the extension into the VS Code environment.

All major features are implemented as independent modules under the extension runtime:
- bb-crawler: Connects to the Blackboard User Database and fetches course materials using secure credentials and session handling. (completed)
- todo-list: Allows users to manage course-related or personal task lists. (completed)
- note-taking: Enables structured or unstructured note creation linked to specific courses or tasks.
- collaboration-edit: Supports collaborative workflows, such as shared note editing or project tracking.
- ai-integration: Interfaces with an external third-party AI server to provide intelligent features like summarization, chatbot Q&A, and task suggestions. (half completed)
External Systems
- Blackboard User Database: Serves as the official data source for course content and metadata.
- Third-Party AI Server: Provides AI services such as natural language processing and chat capabilities.
